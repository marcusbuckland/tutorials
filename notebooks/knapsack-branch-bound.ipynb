A typical relaxation of combinatorial optimisation is to remove the integer constraints, i.e., the variables can take continuous values. This can convert the problem into a **linear programming** problem, which can be easily solved by algorithms such as the [simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm).\n",
